# Annam AI Hackathon

Welcome !!!!!

NOTE : Downloads and setup has been included in both of the README.md. Kindly look into that.

NOTE : In challenge 2 I haven't done any training, was not required in my approach. In place of /Notebooks I have uploaded the two model.pth files using github lfs

##  Challenges Overview

###  Challenge #1: Multiclass Soil Type Classification

**Goal:**  
Classify images into one of **four** soil types:  
- **Alluvial Soil**  
- **Black Soil**  
- **Clay Soil**  
- **Red Soil**

**Details:**  
This is a **multiclass classification** problem. The dataset consists of labeled images, and the model is trained to predict the correct soil type based on visual features.

###  Challenge #2: Is soil or not (Binary Classification)

**Goal:**  
Detect the **is the image is soil image or not** of a particular soil condition or characteristic from **single-label image data**.

**Details:**  
This is a **binary classification** task with limited labeled data. The focus is on improving generalization from sparse labels.
